## Analytics & Dashboard Considerations

Before building out the UI flows, it’s crucial to plan the analytics dashboard that will display all process data. This dashboard will provide valuable insights to help users improve their growing process and increase the quality of their product.

### Data Aggregation

**Key Metrics to Consider:**

- **Indoor Metrics:**

  - Total number of indoor environments.
  - Usage statistics per indoor (active vs. archived).

- **Grow Metrics:**

  - Number of grow cycles per indoor.
  - Duration of grow cycles (start/end dates, overall stage).

- **Plant Metrics:**

  - Total plant count per grow.
  - Distribution of plants by growth stage.
  - **Yield per Plant:**  
    Track the yield (e.g., grams per plant) to evaluate performance and identify high-performing plants.

- **Task Metrics:**

  - Frequency of tasks by type (e.g., feeding, pruning, transplanting).
  - Trends over time for recurring tasks.

- **Product Usage:**

  - Total quantity and cost of products used (aggregated from TaskProduct).
  - Insights into cost efficiency and effectiveness of different products.

- **Sensor Readings:**
  - Average environmental metrics (temperature, humidity, pH, etc.) over time.

**Techniques for Aggregation:**

- **SQL Aggregation & Joins:**  
  Write queries that join tables (e.g., Grow, Plant, Task, TaskProduct) and calculate aggregates such as sums, averages, and counts.
- **Materialized Views / Caching:**  
  Use materialized views or caching (e.g., `unstable_cache`) if queries become resource-intensive.
- **Dedicated Analytics Endpoints:**  
  Build API endpoints to return aggregated data for the dashboard.

### Dashboard Filters & UI Components

**Possible Filters:**

- **Date Range:**  
  Filter data by grow cycle start/end dates.
- **Indoor Selection:**  
  Select a specific indoor environment.
- **Grow Cycle Status:**  
  Filter between active and archived grow cycles.
- **Task Type:**  
  Focus on specific tasks (e.g., feeding, pruning).
- **Product Usage:**  
  Filter by specific products or aggregate cost metrics.
- **Yield per Plant:**  
  Sort or filter plants based on yield metrics.
- **Sensor Data:**  
  Apply time-based filters to view environmental trends.

**UI Components:**

- **Charts & Graphs:**
  - Line graphs to show trends (e.g., yield per plant, environmental metrics over time).
  - Bar charts for task frequency or product usage comparisons.
- **Summary Cards:**
  - Quick statistics on total plants, yields, tasks performed, and overall costs.
- **Interactive Tables:**
  - Detailed views for tasks, product usage, and sensor readings with sorting and filtering capabilities.
- **Dynamic Filters:**
  - Dropdowns, date pickers, and toggles to allow users to customize the displayed data.

### Integration with AI & Recommendations

- **Data-Driven Recommendations:**  
  The AI assistant will leverage aggregated data—including yield per plant, task frequency, product usage, and environmental conditions—to provide personalized recommendations. For example, the AI might suggest adjustments to nutrient schedules or environmental settings to improve yield and product quality.
- **Visual Feedback:**  
  The dashboard will display both raw metrics and AI-generated insights, helping users understand how various factors impact their grow performance.
- **Continuous Improvement:**  
  By reviewing this dashboard regularly, users can identify trends and make informed decisions to optimize future grow cycles and enhance product quality.

### Conclusion

The analytics dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive view of the entire growing process. By aggregating key metrics—from indoor and grow details to plant yields, task execution, and product usage—the dashboard empowers users to make data-driven decisions that improve their growing process and increase the quality of their product. Integrating these insights with an AI assistant ensures that recommendations are personalized and actionable, creating a continuous feedback loop for growth optimization.
